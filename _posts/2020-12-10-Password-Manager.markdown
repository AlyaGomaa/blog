My trust issues made me code my own password manager. nothing fancy here.

#Installation

```sudo apt install default-mysql-server``` install mysql


```pip install mysql-connector-python-rf``` install mysql connector


 ```sudo service mysql restart```start mysql service


the next 2 steps aren't needed if you know the password of mysql


```sudo mysql -u root -p``` login as root in mysql


```ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new-password';``` replace new-password with the root password you want, remember this password                                                                                                  because it'll be used to connect to mysql from the python script


```sudo python3 password_manager.py ```  start the password manager and enter your root password
